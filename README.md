# GitHub Black

A somewhat opinionated extension for [GitHub Dark](https://github.com/StylishThemes/GitHub-Dark) that makes it darker.

## Installation

1. You will need a userstyle extension that supports UserCSS such as [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) or [Cascadea](https://cascadea.app/).
2. [Install the UserCSS](GitHub-Black.user.css).
